# The Brew Diary

-----------------

This is the first web app I have created, I made it using 
-html
-js
-css
-sql
-node
-express
-cors
-selenium
-chrome driver

My goal was to create a website that I could use easily manipulate the data of all the beers
from a local bar, I gathered all the information by scraping it from the website of said bar
and seeding a data base with said information. On top of that I wanted there to be capability
for people to log into the website to create posts for each drink they tried, giving it a rating
and discription so that other users would be able to see what people thought about a given drink by either
going to the profile for the specific beer or by looking at the beer's average rating in the data table.
An additional functionality is that users are allowed to go back and edit or delete their posts.
